        Hello and welcome to the website for Aaron Filson Ceramics. My artistic journey
        has been straight forward in some ways, and in others not so much. For more
        information on my background, read the <a href="#/bio">Bio</a> I have written
        for myself. You may be interested in learning more about the projects I have
        going. Check the progress <a href="#/projects">here</a>. There are a number of
        terms that are used by potters and ceramic artists, and which are not in
        common usage. I have written a short page of <a href="#/ceramicsterms">terms</a>,
        explained in a way that you will better understand the rest of my website,
        and perhaps the ceramics world in general.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps my favorite part of the website is the <a href="#/gallery">gallery</a>.
        I have a small collection of photographs posted there to show my prior work
        and art. The progress in my artistic sensibilities and thematic choices is
        highlighted in this gallery section.
      </p>
      <p>
        A small page of contact info and other links are here at the <a href="#/contact">contact</a>
        page. At this point it is easiest to use the Facebook interface to contact me
        but I know that there are real people who are on the internet and not on
        Facebook.
      </p>
      <p>
        A while ago, I changed hosting providers, and this website disappeared from the
        web. Now back, and newly improved, the website should give you a window into what
        I am working on, and some of the projects of the past. You will also want to visit
        the Facebook page I have set up: https://wwww.facebook.com/AaronFilsonCeramics .
